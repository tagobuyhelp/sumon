## 📚 My Journey

Born in a modest village in Murshidabad, I chose a path less traveled. I dropped out of law college and pursued real-world learning — odd jobs, technical training, and entrepreneurial hustle. From a small computer center to working in Saudi Arabia, each step sharpened my business skills.

In 2016, I founded **EME Academy** in Kolkata to bridge India’s skill gap.

**Achievements:**
- Trained 6,000+ students  
- Created multiple job-generating ventures  
- Authored: *"How to Become a Successful Businessman"*  
- Founded: *Ek Nojore Magazine*
